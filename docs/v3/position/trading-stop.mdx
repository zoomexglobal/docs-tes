Set the take profit, stop loss or trailing stop for the position.
> **Normal account covers: USDT perpetual / Inverse contract**

:::tip
Passing these parameters will create conditional orders by the system internally. The system will cancel these orders if the position is closed, and adjust the qty according to the size of the open position.
:::

:::info
New version of TP/SL function supports both holding entire position TP/SL orders and holding partial position TP/SL orders.
* Full position TP/SL orders: This API can be used to modify the parameters of existing TP/SL orders.
* Partial position TP/SL orders: This API can only add partial position TP/SL orders.
:::

:::note
Under the new version of Tp/SL function, when calling this API to perform one-sided take profit or stop loss modification
on existing TP/SL orders on the holding position, it will cause the paired tp/sl orders to lose binding relationship.
This means that when calling the cancel API through the tp/sl order ID, it will only cancel the corresponding one-sided
take profit or stop loss order ID.
